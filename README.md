# HelioMetric
Helio-Metric is an open-source framework that correlates heliospheric data (NOAA Solar Cycle feeds) with local temporal variables (Calendar cycles). It uses node-based graphs to visualize how external high-energy events (Solar Maximums) interact with static internal datasets (User Profiles).
